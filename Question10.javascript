10.// Solution


The output of the code will be:

1
4
2
3

Explanation:

1. `console.log(1);` - This prints "1" to the console immediately when the code is executed.

2. `setTimeout(printNumber, 0, 2);` - This schedules the `printNumber` function to be called with an argument of `2` after a delay of 0 milliseconds. Even though the delay is set to 0, JavaScript will still execute it asynchronously after the current synchronous code has finished executing. Therefore, it won't immediately log "2".

3. `setTimeout(printNumber, 100, 3);` - This schedules the `printNumber` function to be called with an argument of `3` after a delay of 100 milliseconds. Since this `setTimeout` has a non-zero delay, it will be executed after the previous `setTimeout` with delay 0.

4. `console.log(4);` - This prints "4" to the console immediately when the code is executed.

Now, let's see how the code execution unfolds:

- `console.log(1);` is executed first, so it logs "1" to the console.

- `setTimeout(printNumber, 0, 2);` and `setTimeout(printNumber, 100, 3);` are scheduled, but they don't execute immediately due to the specified delays.

- `console.log(4);` is executed next, so it logs "4" to the console.

- After the synchronous code execution is complete, the event loop checks the timer queue and starts executing the scheduled callbacks.

- `printNumber(2)` is executed by the first `setTimeout`, so it logs "2" to the console.

- `printNumber(3)` is executed by the second `setTimeout`, so it logs "3" to the console.
